# React-pratice

This is a react practice to develop front-end website mostly learned by a Coursera course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/front-end-react/home/info). All the works are done by myself.

In this practice, React Router, single page application, react forms, flow architecture, redux and client-server communication are applied. 


[4/3/2021 Update: I just tried to open this project to have a look. But I failed, it was working one month ago while building. It's probably because the incompatible versions of several dependencies. I am working to solving it now! ] ---- Fixed (new version in 'fixed react-practice' repo)
